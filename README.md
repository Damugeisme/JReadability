OVERVIEW
--------

JReadability is a Java port of arc90's original Javascript project Readability.
(The original Readability.js project is now migrated to become a server-side
platform which as far as I know is no longer open source.)

JReadability is a library that parses HTML as input and returns clean,
easy-to-read text.

JReadability is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Feel free to 
fork and/or improve it.


DEPENDENCY
----------

JReadability depends on the jsoup library.

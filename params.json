You can obtain the\r\noutput with:\r\n\r\n    String cleanHtml = readability.outerHtml();\r\n\r\nBy default debug logs are printed using `System.out.println()`.  You may\r\nalternatively use your own logging mechanisms by overriding the `dbg()` \r\nmethods.  For instance, on Android you may choose to do this:\r\n\r\n    Readability readability = new Readability(html) {\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void dbg(String msg) {\r\n            Log.d(LOG_TAG, msg);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void dbg(String msg, Throwable t) {\r\n            Log.e(LOG_TAG, msg, t);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCY\r\n----------\r\n\r\nJReadability depends on the [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/) library.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE\r\n---------\r\n\r\n+ [blog post](http://blog.wu-man.com/2012/10/introducing-jreadability-making-web.html)\r\n+ arc90's [readability project](http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/)\r\n+ fivefilters [php-readability](http://code.fivefilters.org/php-readability)\r\n+ jhy's [jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/) parser\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTE\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute code to JReadability you can do so through \r\nGitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n-------\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not \r\nuse this file except in compliance with the License.
